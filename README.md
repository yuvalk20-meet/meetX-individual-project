## Part 1: Finalize "Cart" Feature
In store.html: 
1. Display products directly from the database. 
(Hint: Pass a variable in the app route into the store template)

2. Make it so when you click on "Add To Cart" button
it adds the selected product to the Cart table. 
(Hint: Use "add_to_cart()" function from the previous lab)
</br>
In cart.html:</br>
3. Display products that were added to cart directly from the database.
</br>
4. Add a simple "Pay Now" button.

## Part 2: Creating Our Admin Portal
1. Create a new app route and a new html file that has a "log in" form. Make it so only your desired username and password can log in.

2. Create an another app route and another html file and call it "portal.html", this will be the portal the admin can log into and control the website's database.

3. In portal.html:
- Create a table that shows all the products.
- In the table, have an "edit product" feature.
- In the table, have a "delete product" feature.
- After creating a table, create a new form for "adding products" feature.

## Part 3: Finalize your website design

Ideas for design:
- Add a carousel (Slide show)
- Add a navbar

## BONUS:
- Implement a real "Paypal" API, and link it inside the cart.html to pay for the products. (You can find useful info here: https://developer.paypal.com/)
